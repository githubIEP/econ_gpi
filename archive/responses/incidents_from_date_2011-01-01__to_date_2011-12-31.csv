The attack was one of 13 coordinated explosions that struck neighbourhoods across Baghdad during rush hour. At least 60 people were killed and over 200 others wounded. The bombings began at approximately 0630hrs and targeted shops, markets, schools, hospitals and government buildings in Sunni, Shia and mixed sectarian neighbourhoods. The timing of the attack shows they were designed to inflict maximum levels of casualties and disruption.
The bombings occurred five days after US troops withdrew from Iraq and as the country faces a deepening  political crisis. On 19th December, the government issued an arrest warrant for the vice president on charges of terrorism. Tariq al-Hashemi denied the charges, and fled to the semi-autonomous Kurdish Region (KR). The allegations by the Shia prime minister against the Sunni vice president heightened sectarian tension in the country.
On 12th December, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) - the most active terrorist group in Iraq -  issued a communiqué threatening a new campaign of attacks. The last waves of coordinated attacks took place on 15th August during Ramadan and were claimed by the ISI; in that instance, the group also issued a statement threatening attacks during the Muslim holy month.

14456,Unknown,True,3,"At approximately 03:00, Mauritanian security forces prevented a large-scale suicide attack in Nouakchott by firing a shell at an explosive-laden Toyota Land Cruiser approximately eight miles outside the city. The resulting blast killed three suspected Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) militants, and injured eight Mauritanian soldiers.
 
Security personnel were aware that a three vehicle convoy had entered the country from  Mali on 28 February, and began pursuit on 1 February. The army captured one of the vehicles in the town of R'kiz and arrested its driver, a suspected AQIM member. During interrogation the assailant reportedly revealed that the convoy planned to conduct a major attack in Nouakchott.
After receipt of this information security forces were subsequently able to track the vehicles, and prevent the suspected suicide attack. The third vehicle was later found abandoned. It was not clear if it was carrying explosives.
AQIM claimed responsibility for the attempted attack in a telephone call to an Islamist website and stated that the intended target was the Mauritanian president, whose government has actively pursued militants affiliated with the organisation.
This attempted assault was similar in nature to a foiled suicide operation on 25 August 2010, when AQIM militants attempted to drive an explosives-laden vehicle into an army barracks in the eastern town of Nema, near the Malian border. Security forces prevented that attack in the same way; by firing at the vehicle before it reached its destination.
AQIM funds its activities through the kidnapping and ransom of foreigners. The abduction of two French nationals in Niamey, Niger's capital, on 7 January was the latest example of a trend which has rendered the stretch of Saharan desert spanning Mauritania, Mali and Niger an effective no-go area.","Reuters, Associated Press, ANI",,2011-02-02,2011-02-02,Night,night,Night,night,Bombing,18.004202835999152,-15.97686767578125,100-200m,"Riyadh, Nouakchott",MRT,Mauritania,North Africa,Undetermined,Explosives,3,0,9,Mauritania: 3,Mauritania: 0,Mauritania: 9,Algeria:Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM):Global Islamist,0.0,Vehicle-borne,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 22:02:05+0000,2021-07-11 10:38:38+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), perpetrator_type: Global Islamist,is_claimed: True, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

The explosive device was detonated remotely by mobile phone as the vehicle, in which Buddhist rubber plant workers were passengers, passed. All of the victims were believed to be Buddhists.
No group claimed responsibility. However, given the target we believe that it is highly likely that Islamic separatists insurgents were the perpetrators.
In the three southern provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani, one of the key sources of income is the rubber trade. Rubber plantations are mostly owned by the regions Buddhists who employ predominantly Buddhist staff, which breeds resentment amongst the Malay Muslim population.
These provinces were annexed by Thailand from neighbouring Malaysia in 1902 and the bulk of the population is of Malay extraction, with the Thai speaking Buddhists a minority. Bomb attacks remain relatively uncommon in Yala, though this incident took place just shortly a week after a bomb attack on another of the province's rubber plants in Talor Halor.","Reuters, BBC, Bangkok Post.",,2011-01-25,2011-01-25,Unspecified,unspecified,Unspecified,unspecified,Bombing,6.201696104947157,101.25139474868774,100-200m,Yala,THA,Thailand,Asia Pacific,Civilians/General Public; Agricultural Sector,Explosives,9,0,2,Thailand: 9,Thailand: 0,Thailand: 2,Afghanistan:Unknown:Undetermined,0.0,Emplaced,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 22:01:22+0000,2021-07-11 10:38:10+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Unknown, perpetrator_type: Undetermined,is_claimed: False, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

14366,Domodedovo Airport,True,1,"A suicide attack killed 35 people and wounded 168 more in the baggage area of the international arrivals hall at Domodedovo Airport in Moscow. Amongst those killed or injured were known to be British, French, German, Slovakian, Italian, Serbian, Tajik, Uzbek and Kyrgyz citizens.
Preliminary reports said that the device, equivalent to 7kg of TNT, caused the explosion. Screws and other shrapnel were found at the scene, which suggests that the bomber intended to cause as many casualties as possible. It is believed that the assailant was able, as a result of the laxity of security at the airport, to walk directly into the arrivals hall with a bomb carried within a suitcase.
Security was heightened at the city's Vnukovo and Sheremetyevo airports in response to the attack, and the baggage of all passengers, whether they arrived by ground transport or the Aeroexpress train, was inspected. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev subsequently pledged 3 million roubles to the families of each person killed, launched an investigation into the incident and requested that interior ministers draft plans for a radical revision of transport security within the country.
No terrorist organisation claimed the attack.
The last major terrorist operation in the Russian capital took place on 29 March 2010, when a female suicide bomber detonated her explosives upon a metro train at the Park Kultury underground station. Fifteen people were killed and 34 injured as a result. It is believed that the perpetrators of that incident were militants linked to the Caucasus Emirate, a group which is known to have conducted operations outside of the North Caucasus region, including the November 2009 bomb attack on the Nevsky Express.
Though widely regarded as Moscow's most modern airport, there had been previous criticisms of Domodedovo's security infrastructure and procedures. In 2004, two suicide bombers boarded planes having illegally purchased tickets from airport personnel, and subsequently detonated their explosives in mid-air, killing the 90 passengers aboard the two flights in the process. In this case, entrance to the arrivals hall was easily secured, as an adequate control system was lacking, with neither people nor luggage subjected to procedural scans which are the norm in airports in the USA and Great Britain.","Reuters, Interfax, RIA Novosti",,2011-01-24,2011-01-24,Afternoon,afternoon,Afternoon,afternoon,Bombing,55.412938310736685,37.90111541748047,100-200m,"Domodedovo Airport, Moscow",RUS,Russia,Eurasia,Civil Aviation ,Explosives,35,0,168,Russia: 35,Russia: 0,Russia: 168,Afghanistan:Unknown:Undetermined,0.0,Person-borne,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 22:01:17+0000,2021-07-11 10:38:07+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Unknown, perpetrator_type: Undetermined,is_claimed: False, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

The device was planted in a car park on the outskirts of the city where observers of an event to mark the end of Arbaeen had parked their vehicles. A second bomb was found nearby and dismantled prior to detonation. The devices had been planted despite the presence of a security cordon of 120,000 police and security officials.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack, though given the nature of the target and the overt sectarian motive, the perpetrators were likely to be have been Sunni extremists affiliated with Al-Qaeda, most probably members of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI). These groups view Shias as apostates.
The attack came after a triple suicide bombing on two roads leading to Karbala days earlier killed at least 50 people and injured 150 others.
Arbaeen marks the end of the 40-day mourning period for Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad and an integral figure in the Shia interpretation of Islam.

14349,Police Patrol,False,0,"New People's Army (NPA) militants killed five police officers in an armed ambush in the Iluru village of Rizal. The incident occurred when a law enforcement vehicle drove over a mine, believed to have been planted by the NPA, and then a group of approximately 30 militants opened fire at the car with semi automatic weapons.
This was the first attack to cause multiple casualties since the agreement of a resumption in formal peace talks between the government and the NPA on 18 January. The leftist group, which is believed to retain about 4700 fighters, has been waging a four decade long campaign in rural areas. Despite official hopes for a resolution of the conflict by 2014, regional experts suggest that the major ideological differences which exist between the two parties are likely to prevent a permanent peace.

14369,Passenger Bus,False,0,"Unidentified militants detonated an 81 mm mortar bomb placed under a seat on a passenger bus in the Philippine capital of Manila, in an attack which killed five peopleand injured a further 13. The blast, which took place whilst the bus was in the Makati business district, was triggered remotely through the use of a mobile phone. Local security sources stated that the shell had been placed in the centre of the vehicle in a bid to maximise casualties.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack though radical Islamist groups such as Abu Sayyaf, as well as the leftist guerrilla organisation the New People's Army (NPA), have conducted terrorist operations in the country previously. Security officials noted the parallels between this incident and the attack conducted by Abu Sayyaf on 14 February 2005, which occurred on the same road in Manila and also involved the use of a remote controlled device planted on a bus. In addition, such devices have been used in attacks on the southern island of Mindanao where the group maintains a strong operational presence.
The timing, power and location of the explosion suggest that this attack, whilst clearly intended to maim or kill the passengers, was also aimed at destabilising the capital city's central business hub.
The incident occurred upon the same day that suspected NPA militants conducted an armed ambush attack upon government security forces.
In November the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand stated in travel advisories that Manila was a possible target for a terrorist attack. However, incidents such as this one are rare in the capital, with the last recorded assault a bomb operation conducted by Abu Sayyaf in November 2009, which caused no casualties. The bulk of the country's terrorist attacks occur in the south, particularly in Mindanao, known as a stronghold for the Al-Qaeda linked group.","BBC, Associated Press, Asia Sentinel, Bloomberg, Philippine Inquirer, Reuters",,2011-01-24,2011-01-24,Afternoon,afternoon,Afternoon,afternoon,Bombing,14.55367790375962,121.02264404296875,100-200m,"Makati Business District, Manila",PHL,Philippines,Asia Pacific,Financial Sector; Civilians/General Public,Explosives,5,0,13,Philippines: 5,Philippines: 0,Philippines: 13,Afghanistan:Unknown:Undetermined,0.0,Emplaced,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 22:01:19+0000,2021-07-11 10:38:08+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Unknown, perpetrator_type: Undetermined,is_claimed: False, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

Major assaults in the Afghan capital had been relatively rare over the preceding year; the last recorded mass casualty attack took place on 25 August 2010 and this was one of only five such incidents over the full calendar year.

14221,Merian Police Station,True,0,"A suicide bomber in an explosives-laden car drove into the heavily fortified Merian police station in Bannu at high speed. The subsequent blast killed 17 and wounded a further 20 people. Local security sources reported that the assailant struck an outer wall of the police compound, which is located in a densely populated area of the district, and that parts of the station along with a mosque inside the facility suffered heavy damage. Some people were buried underneath rubble and amongst those confirmed dead were a number of members of a federal paramilitary police force and civilians praying at the mosque.
The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed the attack, which came after they had threatened in December to launch assaults that targeted police officials involved in counter-terrorism operations.The group said that it was a response to US drone strikes in the tribal areas of the country, which have killed hundreds of militants but also resulted in civilian fatalities. 2009 and 2010 saw a 300% increase in the number of these operations in Pakistan when compared with George W. Bush's second term in office, and the attack took place on the same day that it was announced that 3 people had been killed in neighbouring North Waziristan.
This incident was striking in that it took place merely hours after US Vice President Joe Biden had given a speech in Islamabad. Biden had attempted to quash what he called 'anti-American misperceptions' centred around Washington's motives for its actions in Pakistan. Behind the scenes American officials were reported to have asked Islamabad to step up its military campaign in the tribal areas of the north-west.
Bannu is located near to North Waziristan, one of the troubled Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). The agency has been the target of a number of US drone strikes but is also the only one of these areas in which the Pakistani military has not, so far, conducted counter-terrorism operations. North Waziristan, especially, serves as a safe-haven for Taliban and Al-Qaeda operatives, and the suicide attack seemed precisely timed to provide a warning to the government not to extend the scope of its mission in the tribal borderlands, and an effort to further undermine the already uneasy relationship between the US and Pakistan.","Associated Press, BBC, Channel 4, Reuters",,2011-01-12,2011-01-12,Unspecified,unspecified,Unspecified,unspecified,Bombing,32.98476402559076,70.6062126159668,100-200m,"Merian Police Station, Bannu District, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa",PAK,Pakistan,South Asia,Law Enforcement/Internal Security Forces,Explosives,17,0,20,Pakistan: 17,Pakistan: 0,Pakistan: 20,Pakistan:Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP):National Islamist,0.0,Person-borne,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 22:00:08+0000,2021-07-11 10:37:19+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), perpetrator_type: National Islamist,is_claimed: True, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

14170,Rally for Timi Alaibe,False,0,"Unidentified militants opened fire on a gathering at the country home of Timi Alaibe, a former presidential advisor on Niger Delta affairs and current candidate for the Bayelsa governorship, in an attack which killed four and wounded at least six others. The assailants, armed with semi automatic weapons and cutlasses, stormed the grounds on a white bus and took aim at the crowd after they overpowered security operatives.
Supporters had gathered in their thousands at the house in Opokuma to welcome Alaibe, who was not hurt in the attack, home after he had conducted monitoring of a gubernatorial election re-run in Asaba.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack though Alaibe's previous government involvement may have provided its motivation. He had been integral in the implementation of a government-sponsored amnesty programme in 2009 which offered development of the delta region in exchange for the surrender of arms. This began to unravel in late 2010 after the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), the region's main militant group, launched a new wave of attacks. Other militants who had been refused a role in the amnesty programme were also reported to have established militia groups.
Militants had launched an earlier armed attack on Alaibe's country home in November 2010, a rally for another governorship candidate suffered a similar assault in December, as did another for former military head of state Gen. Muhammadu Buhari. A spokesman for Alaibe however, posited that the attack was the work of political opponents within the current Bayelsa government.","The Nation, Vanguard, Nigerian Tribune, Next",,2011-01-07,2011-01-07,Unspecified,unspecified,Unspecified,unspecified,Armed attack,4.745422675224672,7.043159008026123,100-200m,"Opokuma, Bayelsa State",NGA,Nigeria,West and Central Africa,Government/Political ; Public Spaces,Melee weapons; Firearms,4,0,6,Nigeria: 4,Nigeria: 0,Nigeria: 6,Afghanistan:Unknown:Undetermined,0.0,Undetermined,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 21:59:45+0000,2021-07-11 10:37:01+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Unknown, perpetrator_type: Undetermined,is_claimed: False, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

14081,Church,True,0,"At approximately 00:20 on 1 January, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device outside the Al-Qidissayn church in Alexandria. The bomber timed the attack to kill Coptic Christian as they left midnight mass. The blast killed 21 people and injured 97 more, including 18 Muslims.
Initial reports called the attack a car bombing, but investigating authorities later concluded that a suicide bomber standing among the crowd was responsible. Officials believe he had planned to detonate his explosives inside the church.
The explosive device was reportedly homemade, and contained screws and ball bearings to maximise casualties. It reportedly had the equivalent explosive capacity of 10-15kg of TNT.
No group claimed responsibility for the bombing, and the attack marked a significant escalation in the violent tensions seen between Copts and Islamist extremists over the past year.
Initial speculation in the media suggested that the Al-Qaeda franchise Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) might have had a hand in the attack. This was largely due to threats made by the group dating back to 31 October when it warned the Coptic authorities in Egypt to release two female converts it believes are being held by the church, or it would respond with ‘suicide vests'.
On 31 October, the ISI killed 52 Iraqi Christians and injured 67 others in an attack on a Baghdad church, which it said, was a response to the alleged kidnapping. However, the ISI did not claim responsibility for the Alexandria attack, which decreased the likelihood of its involvement.
The Egyptian government subsequently blamed the attack on the Palestinian group the Army of Islam, which it stated had 'relied on an Egyptian element' in its planning, a fact supposedly admitted by the accomplice during questioning by authorities. The man was one of five Egyptians detained in connection with the attack. Army of Islam, believed to view Al-Qaeda leaders as spiritual mentors, denied the charges, though praised those responsible.
