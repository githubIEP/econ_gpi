9286,"CIA operatives, Xe security contractors",True,1,"A suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest in an attack that killed seven CIA operatives and a Jordanian intelligence officer, and wounded six others in Khost, Afghanistan. The attack occurred inside the US Forward Operating Base (FOB) Chapman, located in close proximity to the FATA tribal areas of Pakistan. The attack was carried out by a Jordanian CIA informer, Khalil Abu-Malal al-Balawi, who was being brought to the military base by his handler allegedly to disclose information about Al-Qaeda (AQ) second-in-command al-Zawahiri.
Al-Balawi, as a high-value CIA asset accompanying his Jordanian intelligence handler, was able to bypass many of the external layers of security into the base to avoid exposing his identity. At the last check where the private security team of Xe (formerly Blackwater) began inspection, he detonated his vest. The explosion killed his handler, four CIA officers and three security contractors. The vehicle shielded several other CIA operatives but at least six were injured. Among those killed were the CIA chief of the Khost base and reportedly the agency's foremost expert analyst on AQ.
Reports after the incident indicate that al-Balawi, also known as Humam Khalil Mohammed, was likely an AQ triple agent. The Jordanian intelligence service (Mukhabarat, or GID) arrested then recruited him in 2007; acting in collaboration with the CIA, the GID moved him to Pakistan then Afghanistan in an attempt to infiltrate Al-Qaeda.  Al-Balawi regularly posted anti-American essays in jihadi internet forums under the name Abu Dujana al-Khorasani and passed information to the CIA about mid-low level AQ operatives in the area. It is unclear if al-Balawi was ever a genuine asset to the CIA, but at some point in the last year he apparently approached the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Afghan Taliban to work with them against the CIA and GID.
Both Afghan and Pakistani Taliban groups, as well as Al-Qaeda initially claimed responsibility for the attack. Due to the location, it is not far fetched to suggest that the Haqqani network may also have cooperated. However, a posthumous video aired on Pakistan television on 9 January purportedly showed al-Balawi with TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud. In the video he claimed that the attack was to avenge the killing of Baitullah Mehsud, and said that all jihadists must attack US targets.
The attack was the most deadly against CIA personnel since the 1983 Beirut bombing. However, despite the severity of the attack, the bombing appears less the result of an intentional long-term operation than the result of a lucky break for the TTP that the group then skillfully orchestrated. The incident marked two important points: that the TTP's skills have been underestimated, and that the cooperation networks of the various jihadi groups in the region are also perhaps stronger that previously assumed.","BBC Monitoring, AP, StratFor, Reuters, Al Jazeera",,2009-12-30,2009-12-30,Unspecified,unspecified,Unspecified,unspecified,Bombing,33.3585,69.8597,100-200m,Khost,AFG,Afghanistan,South Asia,Private Security/Military; Military; Government/Political ,Explosives,8,0,6,United States: 7; Jordan: 1,United States: 0; Jordan: 0,United States: 6; Jordan: 0,Pakistan:Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP):National Islamist,0.0,Person-borne,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 21:22:18+0000,2021-07-11 10:09:04+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), perpetrator_type: National Islamist,is_claimed: True, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

The explosion, caused by 30 pounds of TNT planted in an underground office used by Hamas, killed two junior members and wounded two others. A senior Lebanese security official said details of what happened remained unclear, in part because Hezbollah prevented investigators from visiting the bomb site in the immediate aftermath of the explosion.
Some media reported that the targets may have included top Hamas officials Osama Hamden or Ali Barakeh, however security officials refused to speculate on the intended target or who was responsible. Though the attack happened in a Hezbollah-controlled district, Hamas appeared to have been the target.

9255,NW flight 253,False,0,"Airline passenger Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his lap twenty minutes before Northwest Flight 253 was scheduled to land in Detroit, Michigan. At about 12:00 passengers reportedly heard a popping noise and smelled smoke. Passengers around Abdulmutallab rushed to subdue him and put out the fire he had started to ignite the concealed explosives. The failed explosion injured the suspect as well as another passenger.
According to a federal indictment the bomb Abdulmutallab allegedly hid in his underwear contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate, the explosive known as PETN, and triacetone triperoxide, or TATP. These explosives failed to detonate when Adbulmutallab ignited them.
According to officials, Abdulmutallab, a 23 year-old Nigerian engineering student, admitted he was an AQ agent, and that he had gotten the explosives in Yemen during his initial interrogation. Days later in an internet statement, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) claimed the attack stating it was retaliation for the US attacks targeting AQAP in Yemen. The statement added that it provided the Nigerian suspect with a technically-advanced device, which failed to go off due to a technical error. How strong the association is between the suspect and AQAP is suspect, however.
Officials believe that Abdulmutallab was first radicalized in London, where he lived from 2005 to 2008 while he studied at University College of London. His links to Yemen are believed to stem from a summer trip to Sanaa in 2005.
Abdulmutallab was already in a law enforcement-intelligence database after his father contacted the Nigerian US embassy over worrying text messages he received from his son in Yemen. Abdulmutallab was denied entry into the UK but was not on the US government's ""no-fly"" list. Reports also suggest that the CIA and NSA had intercepted Al-Qaeda conversations concerning a Nigerian operative who would enter the US to carry out terrorist attacks. The US intelligence community drew great criticism and skepticism for its perceived failures on the incident.
On 6 January 2010 a federal grand jury officially indicted Abdulmutallab on 6 criminal counts, including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder.

One of the assailants used a rocket launcher to fire towards the ISI complex on Qasim Bela road, followed by others throwing grenades. In the subsequent confusion, police believed that the terrorists then drove a car into the ISI complex where at least two suicide bombers detonated their bombs.
The building was severely damaged and at least 12 people were killed during the attack, 25 wounded. The attack came within one day of twin bombings in Lahore, and a suicide attack outside a court in Peshawar. Also of note is that the attack took place in Prime Minister Gilan's constituency.
The TTP has launched an unprecedented wave of deadly attacks, largely presumed as retaliation for the military offensive in Waziristan. Most of the attacks in recent weeks occurred in the FATA and NWFP areas, particularly Peshawar. However the larger attacks of the last two days were in Punjab province, closer to Pakistan's main government institutions. Intelligence authorities believed that future attacks would generally follow this trend of targeting more central institutions.
If the attack was carried out by the TTP, it would also further underscore its expanding operational range in Pakistan, likely with the cooperation of other radical jihadist groups in the country such as the Lashkar-I-Jhangvi (LJ).","BBC, Al JAzeera",,2009-12-08,2009-12-08,Unspecified,unspecified,Unspecified,unspecified,Bombing,30.188612046404867,71.40478134155273,100-200m,"Multan district, Punjab province",PAK,Pakistan,South Asia,Government/Political ,Explosives; Firearms; Grenade,12,0,25,Pakistan: 12,Pakistan: 0,Pakistan: 25,Pakistan:Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP):National Islamist,0.0,Person-borne,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 21:20:36+0000,2021-07-11 10:07:52+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), perpetrator_type: National Islamist,is_claimed: False, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

9017,Civilian Bus,False,0,"A large explosion occurred in the morning in the Sayyida Zeinab district of central Damascus. According to Syria's Interior Ministry, the explosion occurred while a bus carrying Iranian tourists refueled at a petrol station approximately 500 metres away from the al-Sayyida Zeinab shrine, a popular Iranian pilgrimage site.
Initial reports from several witnesses suggested that a bomb may have caused the blast and that up to six people were killed and a dozen injured. They noted the possibility of an attack on Iranian pilgrims, or links to the visit by Saeed Jalilee, Iranian national security adviser and chief nuclear negotiator, meeting in Damascus that day.
However the Syrian Interior Ministry officially ruled out a terrorist attack and denied that the bus carried any pilgrims. It reported that the bus had been empty, that the explosion came from a burst tyre, and that the three people killed were the bus driver and two petrol station workers. It stated there were no further injuries. However, the official account that it was not an attack preceded official investigations to establish the facts, and so may be lacking credibility.
On the one hand, bomb explosions in a country with such tight security control are rare, and an explosion at a petrol station while a large vehicle refueled would probably have inflicted more damage. On the other hand, such attacks have occurred. In September 2008 a suicide car-bomb blamed on Sunni militant group Fatah al-Islam killed at least 17 people in the outskirts of Damascus. Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) has also been steadily increasing its presence in Syria over the past year. Moreover, images released from the site seemed to indicate something larger than a burst-tyre, and at least one Syrian journalist on-site stated there had been an explosion on the bus while the driver and his assistant conducted repairs at the back of it.

8953,A commuter train,False,0,"27 people were killed and over 90 others wounded in a Nevsky Express train crash, which the Russian authorities said was caused by a terrorist attack. It was the largest terrorist attack in Russia but outside of the North Caucasus in five years.
Indications that the incident was a terrorist attack stemmed from a crater discovered near the railway track and passengers reportedly heard a loud bang just before the derailment. The driver also reported an explosion under the locomotive, and a large quantity of smoke filling the train immediately after the crash. Remnants of an explosive device were also found at the scene,a spokesman for theofficialinvestigative committee said. Intelligence services believed the explosion was made from a device equivalent to 7kg of TNT. Hours later a second lesser-explosion went off by remote control during the clean-up that injured several investigators, including the head of the Prosecutor's office.
The primary attack occurred at night while the train was travelling on one of the busiest rail routes in Russia, between Moscow and St.Petersburg. The Nevsky Express is a luxury train popular with tourists, business executives and government officials; investigators consider the attack to be on the 'elite' as the train service has increasingly been used to transfer parts of government functions to St. Petersburg. The attack occurred nearthe town of Bologoye, on the border between the Tver and Novgorod regions. Among the dead were several ranking government and local officials.
The same train service was bombed by Chechen terrorists two years before, in an attack that injured 27 people. The attack has been claimed by both Combat-18, a little-known Russian nationalist group, and by the 'Caucasian Mujahedin', part of the militant group Caucasus Emirate led by Chechen Dokka Umarov. The latter appears the more credible claim, and its letter threatened further attacks on Russian infrastructure.
The claim of responsibility highlights that the terrorist threats in the North Caucasus are no longer solely part of a Chechen agenda, and that radical Islamist motivations have become increasingly integrated across the various republics.","BBC, Times, Xinhua, Interfax",,2009-11-27,2009-11-28,Evening,evening,Night,night,Bombing,57.908281996451095,33.97178649902344,100-200m,"Bologoye, Russia",RUS,Russia,Eurasia,Tourism/Hospitality; Government/Political ; Public Transportation,Explosives,27,0,90,Russia: 27,Russia: 0,Russia: 90,Russia:Caucasus Emirate:National Islamist,0.0,Emplaced,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 21:19:38+0000,2021-07-11 10:07:12+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Caucasus Emirate, perpetrator_type: National Islamist,is_claimed: True, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

8908,Gas pipeline,False,0,"Unidentified assailants planted a bomb at the 518th kilometre of the Mozdok-Gazimagomed natural gas pipeline in Dagestan, however security forces were able to detonate it safely. The device consisted of a 12-litre bucket of aluminium powder and ammonium nitrate, roughly equal to ten kilograms of TNT. Witnesses reported no disruption to the gas distribution or other casualties. No group claimed the attempted attack but the Dagestani Jamaat Sharia is suspected as it has carried out similar attacks before.
It was the third attack on Dagestan gas pipelines in the past month. Two similar bombs were detonated on 11 November that caused a power black-out for more than half a million people.
The attacks seem to indicate increasing hostility to energy companies in the North Caucasus region. Oil installations and pipelines were frequent targets of terrorist activity during the Chechen wars, as in other parts of the world. Coupled with the recent assassination of an employee of Ingushetia's largest energy company, the incidents suggest that militant groups will continue to target energy companies to impact energy supplies and incite fear among the population.","ESISC, Interfax",,2009-11-26,2009-11-26,Morning,morning,Morning,morning,Bombing,43.24520272203359,47.021484375,100-200m,Dagestan,RUS,Russia,Eurasia,Gas Sector,Explosives,0,0,0,Russia: 0,Russia: 0,Russia: 0,Russia:Dagestani Jamaat Sharia:National Islamist,0.0,Other,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 21:19:19+0000,2021-07-11 10:06:57+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Dagestani Jamaat Sharia, perpetrator_type: National Islamist,is_claimed: False, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

According to local sources, an unidentified suicide bomber attacked a unity meeting of tribal and military Sunni-Shi'a leadership in the Pishin area in Sarbaz District of Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province at 04:50. 49 people were reported killed and roughly 50 were injured. The casualties included 20 tribal leaders and close to 20 Iranian Revolutionary Guards, five of them senior, including Brigadier General Nur Ali Shushtari, deputy head of the Guards ground forces. A three-day mourning was declared in the province.
Jundullah claimed the attack, a Sunni extremist group. Some govermental leadership quickly accused foreigners for the attacks, including Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, as well as the US and the UK for possible intelligence links to the Jundullah group. The accusation comes at a particularly bad time for the IAEA negotiations in Vienna.
Local media seem to believe that the main goal of the attack was to drive a wedge between the mixed Sunni-Shi'a population of the Sistan-Baluchistan province. The assumption is that the terrorist attack in the Pishin region, one close to Iran's border with Pakistan, indicated a fear of the strengthening of unity between Iranian Shi'a and Sunni Muslims.","Fars News Agency, BBC monitoring; IRNA",,2009-10-18,2009-10-18,Night,night,Night,night,Bombing,26.635183800721723,61.248779296875,100-200m,"Sarbaz district, Sistan-Baluchestan province",IRN,Iran,Middle East,Military; Civilians/General Public; Government/Political ,Explosives,49,0,50,Iran: 49,Iran: 0,Iran: 50,Iran:Jundallah:National Islamist,0.0,Person-borne,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 21:15:52+0000,2021-07-11 10:04:30+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Jundallah, perpetrator_type: National Islamist,is_claimed: True, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

While the police had no immediate indication of the motives for the attack, Italian news agencies reported that the man shouted “Out of Afghanistan!” before detonating the bomb, which was rudimentary and not very powerful.
Italy, which currently has 3,100 troops deployed in Afghanistan, remains a potential target of Islamist terrorism.

Some reports suggest that the device was hidden on a passing bus, others that it was hidden in a parked vehicle next to the market. Other accounts suggest that it was remotely detonated or conducted by a suicide bomber. Several other vehicles were destroyed in the explosion. It has been confirmed so far that 54 people were killed and over 100 injured.
No group has claimed the attack, although evidence suggests that the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is the group most likely to be responsible. The attack is most likely to be in response to the upcoming offensive of Pakistani troops in the Waziristan region.
Local officials and police report that it is the second substantial attack in the past few months after the bombing of the Pearl Continental Hotel in June that killed 18. Also of note is that following the attack on the WFP building in Islamabad earlier this week that Peshawar was not considered one of the necessary security zones. This attack thus suggests that higher security measures will be taken in more of Pakistan's major cities.

According to police the gunfight lasted three hours before the CPI-M took the weapons of the slain police and fled back to the forest.
The ambush was one of the bloodiest attacks by the Maoists at a time when India's central government is preparing for a major paramilitary offensive against them. Earlier in the day, police allege the Maoists attacked a government office in the same region.
The ambush comes two days after the CPI-M beheaded an officer elsewhere in a nearby province and serves as reminder of their increasingly brazen tactics.
The attack is likely to intensify pressure on the government to take action against the group . Prime Minister Singh has described the CPI-M as the gravest internal threat to India's security.

7610,Marriott Hotel and Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Jakarta ,True,2,"Two suicide bombers from a Jemaah Islamiya splinter cell group calledTanzim Qaaedat al-jihad  attacked the Ritz-Carlton and Marriott hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia. Indonesian authorities stated that seven civilians were killed along with the two bombers. Over 50 were wounded.
The first bomber detonated his explosives in the Sailendra restaurant at the Marriott hotel during breakfast. The restaurant is located near the lobby of the hotel. CCTV footage showed him carrying a backpack on his chest and rolling luggage towards the restaurant.
When he was stopped by security, he told them he was delivering a case to his boss. Seven people, including the bomber were killed.
The second bomber detonated shortly after in the Airlangga restaurant in the Ritz-Carlton hotel next door. He went into the restaurant and was seated. When he was asked his room number, he said 2701, even though the Ritz only has 26 floors. He then said he was not staying at the hotel and offered to pay cash. The bomb detonated as the waiter went to get his coffee. The bomber and one other were killed.
The bombs contained nails, bolts and ball bearings. The contents remain similar to previous attacks by JI.
A total of seven civilians and two terrorists were killed in the attack and approximately 50 others wounded. The wounded are nationals from Australia, Canada, Hong Kong India, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea and the United States.
Police stated that a third bomb was found and defused on the 18th floor of the Marriott hotel. The bomb was set to explode in room 1808 before the attacks in the lobby of the hotel. Authorities believe that this bomb was meant to send people in the hotel down to the lobby where the suicide attack occurred. Police suspect that the two suicide bombers were guests at the hotel and used the room to construct the explosives.
The Marriott hotel was previously attacked in 2003. A car bomb was detonated in the front of the hotel during the afternoon. A total of 12 people died and 150 were injured.
The attack was claimed by Tanzim Qaaedat al-jihad, a suspected splinter group of Jemaah Islamiya.
The Jemaah Islamiya is an Al-Qaeda affiliated Islamist group which had declined in activity due to increased counterterrorism measures in the past year. The group had attacked the Marriott in 2003 and was responsible for the Bali nightclub bombings in 2002 which killed 202 people.
One of the bombers is believed to be Nur Hasbi. He is a graduate of the Al-Mukmin Islamic boarding school - many alumni of the school have joined JI.
The Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton are next door to each other in Jakarta's business district. The hotels are popular with Western tourists.","Reuters, BBC, CNN",,2009-07-17,2009-07-17,Morning,morning,Morning,morning,Bombing,-6.2279,106.8263,100-200m,Jakarta,IDN,Indonesia,Asia Pacific,Tourism/Hospitality,Explosives,7,0,56,Netherlands: 2; India: 0; New Zealand: 1; Australia: 3; Unknown: 0; Indonesia: 1; Canada: 0,Netherlands: 0; India: 0; New Zealand: 0; Australia: 0; Unknown: 0; Indonesia: 0; Canada: 0,Netherlands: 3; India: 1; New Zealand: 1; Australia: 0; Unknown: 50; Indonesia: 0; Canada: 1,Indonesia:Tanzim Qaaedat al-jihad:Global Islamist,0.0,Person-borne,,Unknown author,2022-10-28 20:44:10+0000,2021-07-11 09:59:41+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Tanzim Qaaedat al-jihad, perpetrator_type: Global Islamist,is_claimed: True, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

One French male was in critical condition in hospital. Authorities defused a second bomb that did not explode. Initial reports indicated that the bombs were thrown by men on motorcycles or were dropped from the hotel balcony above the cafe. However, authorities stated their belief that the bombs were placed under a nearby bench. The explosives were reportedly home-made.
The café was full of French adolescents who were on a school-trip at the time of the attack. It is located in a medieval area near the historic Al Hussein Mosque. The market is a 'must see' according to some Cairo tourist books and is noted for its goods and outdoor coffee shops.
