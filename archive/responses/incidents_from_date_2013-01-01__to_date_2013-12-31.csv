26154,,False,5,"16 gunmen killed at least 67 people and wounded 175 more during an attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi. Al Shabaab has claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter.
On Saturday afternoon, militants entered the shopping mall from its front entrance, via the second floor carpark, throwing grenades. The attackers were dressed in black and wearing turbans. International news reports indicate that they then fired on shoppers and staff. The militants reportedly targetted non-Muslims by asking people to prove that they were believers either by having a Muslim sounding name on their identity cards or by answering questions about the Prophet Muhammad or the Quran. Those that failed were shot and killed.
Security forces entered the building an hour after the attack began. International news reports indicate that a gun battle ensued and the militants subsquently barricaded themselves into the Nakumatt supermarket on the first floor. The attackers had taken an unknown number of hostages and remained in the supermarket overnight. On Sunday evening, security forces landed helicopters on the building's roof and began an operation to retake the mall. Security forces detonated several bombs in the building on Monday morning. By Tuesday evening, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said the seige was over. Five militants were killed and 11 were arrested.
