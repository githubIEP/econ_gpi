29920,,False,0,"Guerrillas, who the authorities suspect are members of the FARC 30th Front, detonated an explosive device in an energy tower in Buenaventura. Nobody was killed or wounded in the attack. However, the destruction of the energy tower caused a power outage affecting 450,000 people.","Buenaventura permaneciÃ³ esta semana sin energÃ­a. Durante tres dÃ­as los porteÃ±os sufrieron las consecuencias de la voladura de una torre. Una realidad que se ha repetido aÃ±o tras aÃ±o en la Ãºltima dÃ©cada.; La voladura de la torre, ubicada en zona rural de Dagua, hizo que el presidente Juan Manuel Santos asegurara que â€œla guerra entre combatientes, no contra la poblaciÃ³n civilâ€ durante un consejo de seguridad en Buenaventura.; SegÃºn las autoridades, el hecho fue cometido por guerrilleros del frente 30 de las Farc, adscritos al Comando Conjunto Occidente.; Otro frente de ese grupo, el 29, derribÃ³ quince torres de energÃ­a en Tumaco, en octubre del aÃ±o pasado. Ese puerto nariÃ±ense permaneciÃ³ tres semanas sin energÃ­a por las voladuras.; Y es que segÃºn reportes de ISA, ese octubre del 2013 se presentÃ³ el mayor nÃºmero de voladuras de torres de energÃ­a en todo el paÃ­s. SegÃºn las cifras conocidas por Colprensa en ese periodo se presentaron 60 voladuras, y agrega ISA que â€œel 70% de los atentados a torres de energÃ­a se concentran en los departamentos de Antioquia, NariÃ±o y Caucaâ€.; En 2013 se derribaron 108 torres en el paÃ­s, 61 mÃ¡s que en 2012 cuando se dinamitaron 42 torres. 73 acciones de este tipo se presentaron en 2011, y 39 en 2010. Este Ãºltimo aÃ±o es el que menos atentados efectivos se dieron desde 2004. Por el contrario, 2005 y 2006 fueron los aÃ±os que mÃ¡s derribamientos perpetrÃ³ la guerrilla con 227 y 241, respectivamente.; Este tipo de acciones, lo mismo que las que tienen que ver con los oleoductos son atribuidas por Inteligencia Militar, entre otros, a los frentes 32 y 48 de las Farc cuyo principal foco es el oleoducto TrasAndino, por lo menos en el sur del paÃ­s. En Arauca y Norte de Santander se habla del frente 10 de esa misma guerrilla, lo mismo que la Columna MÃ³vil Alfonso Castellanos de las Farc.; Y en esa zonas el frente de Guerra HÃ©roes y MÃ¡rtires del ELN es seÃ±alado de cometer los ataques contra las infraestructura petrolera y energÃ©tica.; Un informe de FundaciÃ³n Paz y ReconciliaciÃ³n revelÃ³ que el ELN este aÃ±o -justo en el aniversario 50 y con el inicio de acercamientos para un diÃ¡logo con el Gobierno- aumentÃ³ sus atentados. â€œMientras que en el 2013, durante los primeros seis meses del aÃ±o realizÃ³ 17 ataques contra infraestructura petrolera, para el aÃ±o en curso se han registrado 52, casi la tercera parte de la totalidad de las acciones de esta guerrilla en 2014â€.; Los ataques al polioducto; En los Ãºltimos 15 dÃ­as, la Fuerza PÃºblica frenÃ³, sÃ³lo en el Putumayo, 15 intentos de la guerrilla que pretendÃ­a dinamitar el oleoducto TrasAndino; y en lo que va corrido del aÃ±o la Inteligencia Militar ha impedido que se concreten 81 acciones similares en ese mismo departamento del sur del paÃ­s.; Son cifras que son opacadas por acciones como las ocurridas en las semanas recientes. En la retina de los colombianos han quedado grabadas imÃ¡genes como las del rÃ­o de petrÃ³leo que descendÃ­a por un costado de una vÃ­a en el Putumayo y que poco a poco contaminaba los rÃ­os El Tigre y Guamuez; esto, luego de que el 1 de junio miembros de las Farc, obligaran a los conductores de 23 carrotanques a verter el crudo que transportaban.; Hoy los habitantes del municipio de Orito tienen en sus cuentas 86 ataques a la infraestructura petrolera en 2013, y 39 en 2012. Mientras que los residentes de San Miguel, frontera con el Ecuador, hablan de 17 acciones ilegales en 2013, y 18 en 2012 en su territorio, cifras respaldas por Ecopetrol.; Pero esa no es la Ãºnica zona del paÃ­s en las que hechos de terror se han ensaÃ±ado contra los tubos por los que circula uno de los recursos que mÃ¡s riquezas lleva a las regiones por cuenta de las regalÃ­as. Los municipios de Teorama, TibÃº y ConvenciÃ³n (Norte de Santander) han sido blanco de las Farc y el ELN. Entre 2012 y 2013 se tienen cifras de 42, 26 y 25 acciones terroristas en esas poblaciones, respectivamente, segÃºn la estatal petrolera.; â€œLa guerrilla se concentra alrededor de los oleoductos para afectar la economÃ­a del paÃ­s, eso ademÃ¡s repercute gravemente en el medio ambienteâ€, dice el comandante de la Fuerza AÃ©rea Colombiana (FAC), general Gillermo LeÃ³n LeÃ³n, quien tiene claro que los sitios a los que le estÃ¡ apuntando la guerrilla para mostrar un poder â€œque no tieneâ€ son en el Putumayo por donde atraviesa el oleoducto TrasAndino.; TambiÃ©n se ubican en los departamentos de Arauca, Casanare, Norte de Santander donde estÃ¡ el oleoducto CaÃ±olimÃ³n CoveÃ±as. â€œBuscan lugares donde estÃ¡n mÃ¡s a cubierta para poner sus cargas. En esto tienen que ver mucho las redes de apoyo al terrorismo; es decir, gente de civil que estÃ¡ entre la poblaciÃ³n y que apoya las actividades de estos grupos ilegales. Eso les da una facilidad a los terroristas, pues les permite mimetizarseâ€, aÃ±ade el oficial.; Millonarias pÃ©rdidas; Con el derribamiento de torres o la voladura de oleoductos, ademÃ¡s de afectar la economÃ­a nacional, se produce un fuerte impacto mediÃ¡tico.; SegÃºn cÃ¡lculos de expertos, armar un artefacto para volar una torre o dinamitar un oleoducto no cuesta mÃ¡s de $250 mil, lo que contrasta con los 38 mil millones de pesos por cada mil barriles que se dejan de producir.; â€œEn este semestre en promedio se dejaron de producir 60 mil barriles diarios por parte de Ecopetrolâ€, seÃ±ala el ministro de Minas y EnergÃ­a, Amilkar Acosta, en referencia a los ataques contra la infraestructura petrolera.; En ese mismo sentido el saliente presidente de la AsociaciÃ³n Colombiana de PetrÃ³leo (ACP), Alejandro MartÃ­nez, hizo referencia a 500 millones de dÃ³lares que segÃºn Ã©l han costado los atentados a esa industria y que han impedido la extracciÃ³n de, al menos, 5 millones de barriles de petrÃ³leo. Y hay que sumar el incalculable costo ambiental.; â€œEstas acciones terroristas estÃ¡n generando un daÃ±o de unas proporciones que los delincuentes no miden, todo por tratar de generar miedo en la poblaciÃ³n civil y por detener el transporte del crudo. No piensan en los efectos que estÃ¡n causando sobre los campesinos que sonâ€, dijo el general LeÃ³n.; Los drones; Tres sistemas de aviones no tripulados (drones) de la Fuerza AÃ©rea recopilan informaciÃ³n para evitar atentados contra las infraestructura petrolera. La vigilancia con estos aparatos permite tener en la mira al oleoducto CaÃ±olimÃ³n CoveÃ±as; el TrasAndino, en el sur del paÃ­s y el Bicentenario que va desde Tame y se une al CaÃ±o LimÃ³n.; â€œEstos equipos nos han permitido trabajar de la mano con el EjÃ©rcito y la PolicÃ­a Nacional y sumar en esta estadÃ­stica de neutralizaciones de acciones terroristasâ€, dice LeÃ³n quien no duda en agregar que gracias a esa nueva tecnologÃ­a â€œse han neutralizado 141 acciones terroristasâ€, en lo que va del aÃ±o. Lo propio ha ocurrido con 324 artefactos explosivos improvisados.; William Prieto, responsable por los sistemas de seguridad para la compaÃ±Ã­a alemana Bosch en 17 paÃ­ses, dice que â€œdesde hace mÃ¡s de 20 aÃ±os en Colombia, cuando se explotaban en ese entonces Cusiana y Cupiagua, se empezÃ³ a implementar tecnologÃ­a de punta para poder controlar la operaciÃ³n de la seguridad, lo mismo que el transporte del crudoâ€.; SegÃºn este experto, las compaÃ±Ã­as estÃ¡n invirtiendo entre el 8 y el 12 % de sus presupuestos del proyecto para estar al dÃ­a en temas de tecnologÃ­a pues se miran temas de alarmas, seguridad, informaciÃ³n, control, monitoreo y aspectos de operaciÃ³n de todos los componentes.; http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/judicial/noticias/cuanto-cuestan-ataques-guerrilla-contra-infraestructura; http://www.eluniversal.com.co/colombia/farc-es-responsable-del-ataque-torre-de-energia-en-buenaventura-ejercito-165987",,2014-07-28,2014-07-28,Evening,evening,Evening,evening,Bombing,3.886177,-77.069092,100-200m,"Dagua, Buenaventura",COL,Colombia,Latin America,Electricity Infrastructure,Explosives,0,0,0,,,,Colombia:Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC):Far Left/Revolutionary,0.0,Emplaced,,Unknown author,2022-10-29 11:47:48+0000,2021-07-11 12:10:44+0000,,"perpetrator_name: Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), perpetrator_type: Far Left/Revolutionary,is_claimed: False, is_suspected: False,is_officially_attributed: False"

29152,,False,0,"Boko Haram militants killed about 300 of people during a raid in the town of Gamboru Ngala, on the Nigerian-Cameroonian border, on the night of 6 May, according to international media reports.

If these reports are correct, this would be the largest number of fatalities that we have recorded for an attack by Boko Haram since the group emerged in its current form in 2009. And it would probably be the largest single violent incident perpetrated by an African Islamist militant group since the 1997 Bentalha massacre by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in Algeria.
The gunmen also looted shops and homes, set fire to several buildings, including a police station, and 17 trailers loaded with livestocks.

According to police accounts, a suicide bomber drove up to the checkpoint and detonated the explosives as he stepped out of the vehicle after security forces present at the checkpoint had warned him. The head of the Peshawar police said that the target may have been ‘either the Iranian Consulate or another nearby office'. In addition to the consulate, there are several NGO offices and schools in the University Town area, as well as UN offices, the ICRC, and the American Club.
A spokesman for a group led by militant Mast Gul, affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), claimed the attack to Reuters and said the consulate was the intended target. The spokesman warned that the group would ‘continue to target Iranian installations and the Shia community everywhere'.
