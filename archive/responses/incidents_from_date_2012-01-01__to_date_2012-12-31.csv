21169,Military command office,False,0,"A car bomb explosion in central Damascus wounded three people.The incident happened near Shukri Qubaitly Street, Abu Roumaneh district, next to a hotel when the UN mission in Syria is based. International news reports suggest none of the UN staff were hurt.
Syrian state TV says the device was attached to a fuel tanker. It is unclear how the bomb was ‘attached' to the petrol tanker, as the Syrian media describes.
Based on other attacks in Syria, it is possible the device was a ‘sticky bomb' - an explosive device attached by magnet or adhesive to a target. Such devices are relatively cheap, use small amounts of explosives and more precise than roadside bombs. They are also easier to get into an area that may have searches on vehicles. A remote signal or a timer also means that the bombers can attach a device to a vehicle at a distance from the point of detonation.  Such an approach would likely be an effective way of breaching security as guards may have presumed it was a delivery for the hotel - this is particularly plausible given ongoing power and fuel shortages in the country.
There have been previous instances where such devices have been used in Syria, including in central Damascus; on 28 June two sticky bombs exploded outside the Palace of Justice. The vast majority of sticky bomb attacks reported take place in Iraq, and this latest incident may be further evidence that tactics and bomb making techniques from Iraq are impacting the Syrian insurgency.

19018,Policemen,False,0,"An Iranian manwas responsible for three explosions in Bangkok. Two of the blasts occurred in the residential area of Sukhumvit Soi 71, while a third took place in Pridi Bhanomyong Soi 31.
Accounts of the incidents are inconsistent, but police believed the man blew up his rented home, and then threw a grenade at a taxi on Sukhumvit Soi 71 after the driver refused to pick him up. The explosion injured the driver and three local nationals. As the man fled, he hurled a second bomb at police, which rebounded off a tree and caused him severe injuries.
According to an official statement, police searched for two other foreigners with whom the bomber rented his house in Pridi Bhanomyong Soi 31, and who fled the scene of the first explosion before police arrived.
The explosions came a day after the Israeli government blamed Iran for an attack on a diplomatic vehicle in Delhi, and an attempted attack on a local staff member of the Israeli Embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia. These attacks were against Israeli diplomatic targets.
Last month, more than a dozen foreign governments issued warnings of a threat of terrorist attacks in the Thai capital following the discovery of an alleged Hezbollah plot against Israeli and Jewish targets, and the arrest of an alleged Lebanese member of the group.
