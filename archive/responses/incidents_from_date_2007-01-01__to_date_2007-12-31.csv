A group of nine French citizens had departed from Tabuk, travelling south towards the holy city of Madinah (Medina), apparently in search of the remnants of the Hejaz railway. They stopped by the roadside close to Madain Salih. Three men arrived in a pickup truck and separated the males before shooting them. Two men died at the scene and a third on the way to the hospital. A teenage boy died in hospital the following day.
A number of suspects were arrested in March, April and October 2007. Subsequent reporting suggested that the leader of the attack was a Saudi national, Walid ibn Mutlaq Al-Radadi. Al-Radadi featured on a 2005 most wanted list. It was reported that Al-Radadi and a man named Majid ibn Ma'aidh Al-Harbi had been travelling to the village of Al-Melaileh when they saw the French tourists. They returned with Abdullah bin Sayer Al-Muhammadi and carried out the attack. They later joined up with Nasser ibn Latif Al-Balawi.
By October 2007 all four men had been arrested or killed, along with at least eight others suspecting of harbouring or supporting them. Al-Radadi was killed in a shootout with police in Madinah on 6 April 2007.
