# - Add Conflict and Other Dataset Processing to separate script
  # - Add UCDP Candidate Dataset to get conflict status in most recent year, rather than have data lagged one year
# - WRite ML Attribution in Python and Julia, compare performance
# - Add affiliation list to R project, procedures for updating affiliation list #*** Probably needs to be manual for each year based on incident ID rather than broad group, also just for West
